                            <p>RFB Comms is an instant messaging service that we use as our primary means of communication with each other.</p>
                            <p>It's built on <a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a>↪ and has intigration with Jitsi (<code>meet.redfightback.org</code>) and a bunch of bots and plugins that we use to work effectively, like Focalboards.</p>
                            <p class="motivation">⭐ Comms is a useful tool but can be overwhelming to use at first. We have a wide variety of features and practices that make it easier to use.</p>
                            <p>Mattermost is similar to Slack and Discord, so if you've used either of those, you'll have a good idea of how to use Comms.</p>

                            <p>Threads make it easier to sort through and prioritise messages by tucking replies away underneath the original message.</p>
                            <p>You can follow threads so that you don't miss the conversation.</p>
                            <p>A full guide to using threads is available at the link above.</p>

                            <p>The list of DMs will stay the same no matter what Team you're currently in, but when you go to search for people to DM, <b>it will only show you people who are in that Team.</b> To be able to DM anyone, you have to be in the RFB Members team or RFB Public team.</p>
                            <p>If you click on the Context Menu <code>...</code> that shows up when you hover over <code>"Direct Messages"</code> in Comms, you'll get an option to list All DMs you have. By default, Comms will only list 30.</p>

                            <p>Jitsi is a video and voice calling service, and the one that RFB uses because we host it ourselves.</p>
                            <p>To start a Jitsi call, when in a channel or DM, go to the top right of Comms, where there is a little camcorder 📹 icon.</p>
                            <p>Click it and a call will start! To join the call, click the <code>"Join Call"</code> button that was just created in the chat.</p>

                            <p>Focalboards is a work organisational tool. There is a Focalboards page for every channel and DM.</p>
                            <p>You can open Focalboards by going to the target 🎯 icon next to the Jitsi camcorder in the top right of Comms.</p>
                            <p>You can create tickets that help you sort through work, and can embed them into Comms channels so you can see them there.</p>
                            <p>Focalboards is more geared towards being a tool for businesses. The needs of businesses don't translate very well into the needs of a communist party, but we make do with what we have and try to make them fit our needs.</p>

                                <li>Favouriting channels and adding them to groups to arrange them in the sidebar is useful for prioritising what messages you need to read.</li>
                                <li>Muting certain channels and teams is the best way to avoid Comms clogging up your notifications, and making sure that you see what you need to.</li>

                            <p>As in all party spaces, the code of conduct still applies. If you feel like the code of conduct has been breached by a member using comms, you should feel confident in criticising the comrade or talking to a Welfare Secretary about it.</p>
                            <p>You can have longer form discussion to the forums so that it can be more easily referenced - the forums are more suited for thought-out discussion.</p>
                            <p>There is no expectation for members to be consistently caught up on all comms messages, other than messages in #announcements and your branch and committee/s. Members should not expect other members to have read every message.</p>
                            <p>Comms is a fast-moving collaborative environment. If you feel like you’ve missed out on a conversation that you wanted to contribute to, please do not be afraid to bring it back up. Similarly, if you think a discussion would be better at a slower pace, start a forum thread and share it in comms.</p>
                            <p>Comms is what we make of them - it’s up to all of us to ensure that Comms is well organised, productive and supportive.</p>

                            <p>Comms now has a link safety feature to let you know if you’re clicking a link that takes you to a non-Red Fightback site. This is a protection against phishing attacks, to stop you accidentally clicking a link that looks like it goes to a service under our control when it doesn’t. It looks like this:</p>

                            <p>If you have technical problems accessing comms, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to get in contact and sort it out. Try emailing <code>correspondence@redfightback.org</code> or sending a message via the <a href="https://redfightback.org/contact/">contact page</a> if you don’t have anyone’s phone number. There is likely to be a solution!</p>
                            <p>If you get certificate errors in desktop or mobile apps, uninstall and reinstall them in the first instance - this usually fixes most problems.</p>
